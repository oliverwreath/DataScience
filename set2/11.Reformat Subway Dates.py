def reformat_subway_dates(date):
	'''
	The dates in our subway data are formatted in the format month-day-year.
	The dates in our weather underground data are formatted year-month-day.
	
	In order to join these two data sets together, we'll want the dates formatted
	the same way.  Write a function that takes as its input a date in the MTA Subway
	data format, and returns a date in the weather underground format.
	
	Hint: 
	There is a useful function in the datetime library called strptime. 
	More info can be seen here:
	http://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptime
	'''

	# your code here
	tt = datetime.strptime(date, "%m-%d-%y")
	date_formatted = tt.isoformat()[:10]
	return date_formatted
